  "password": "password123"
}
```

### Send Connection Request
```
POST /api/citizens/direct-connection-request/LAWYER_ID
Authorization: Bearer TOKEN
{
  "message": "I need legal advice regarding property law",
  "connectionType": "specific_case"
}
```

### Accept Connection Request
```
POST /api/lawyers/accept-connection-request/CONNECTION_ID
Authorization: Bearer TOKEN
{
  "responseMessage": "I'd be happy to help you with your property law case"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Socket.IO not connecting**: Check CORS settings and authentication
2. **Real-time notifications not working**: Verify socket events are properly set up
3. **Chat messages not sending**: Check authentication and chat room joining
4. **Database errors**: Ensure all models are properly imported and connected

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Monitor network tab for failed API requests
3. Check backend logs for server errors
4. Verify database connections and data integrity

## Next Steps for Enhancement
1. Add file sharing in chats
2. Implement video/voice calling
3. Add lawyer availability scheduling
4. Create payment integration
5. Add case management features
6. Implement lawyer ratings and reviews

## Security Considerations
- All API endpoints are protected with authentication
- Role-based access control prevents unauthorized actions
- Rate limiting on message sending
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure socket connections with authentication

This implementation provides a solid foundation for direct lawyer-citizen communication with room for future enhancements.
